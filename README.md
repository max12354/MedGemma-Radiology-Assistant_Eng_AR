## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**

    You can use either Conda (recommended for easier PyTorch with CUDA installation) or Python's built-in `venv`.

    *   **Using `conda` (Recommended for PyTorch with CUDA):**
        ```bash
        # Create a new Conda environment (e.g., named 'medgemma_env' with Python 3.10)
        conda create --name medgemma_env python=3.10
        conda activate medgemma_env
        ```

    *   **Using `venv` (Python's built-in):**
        ```bash
        # Create a venv (e.g., named 'venv')
        python -m venv venv
        # Activate it:
        # On Windows:
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        # On macOS/Linux:
        # source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install PyTorch with CUDA support:**
    This is crucial for GPU acceleration and performance.
    *   **If using `conda`:** Go to the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), select your OS, **Package: Conda**, Language: Python, and your desired **Compute Platform (CUDA version, e.g., 11.8 or 12.1)**. Run the generated `conda install ...` command.
        *Example for Conda and CUDA 11.8:*
        ```bash
        conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
        ```
    *   **If using `venv` with `pip`:** Go to the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), select your OS, **Package: Pip**, Language: Python, and your desired **Compute Platform (CUDA version, e.g., 11.8 or 12.1)**. Run the generated `pip install ...` command.
        *Example for pip and CUDA 11.8:*
        ```bash
        pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
        ```

4.  **Install other dependencies:**
    Once PyTorch is installed and your environment is active, install the remaining packages from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: The first time you run the application, it might attempt to download NLTK's 'punkt' tokenizer data if it's not found in standard NLTK data locations. If you encounter issues with NLTK, you can try running `python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"` once in your activated environment.*
